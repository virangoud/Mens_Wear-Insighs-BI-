🔍 Observations
  Brands with the highest sale prices tend to show lower profit margins.
  Due to high prices and limited varieties, these brands often record lower sales volumes.
  Top-selling brands usually provide more varieties, giving customers greater choice.
  Brands with reasonable prices plus attractive discounts perform better, achieving good profits despite lower margins.
  There is no single dominant variety — most varieties perform within an average/“okay” range.
